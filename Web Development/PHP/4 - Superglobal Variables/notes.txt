Superglobal variables in PHP are predefined variables that are
accessible from any scope within a PHP script. They are special 
because they are automatically populated by the PHP engine with
specific values related to the current request or environment.
Superglobals are available in both procedural and object-oriented 
programming styles and are used to gather information or manipulate 
data across different parts of a PHP script without the need for
explicit variable passing or global declarations.

The main superglobal variables in PHP include:

$_SERVER: Contains information about the current server and execution 
environment, such as request headers, server details, and script locations.

$_GET: Holds the values of variables passed to the current script via the URL
 parameters.

$_POST: Stores the values of variables submitted to the current script via an 
HTTP POST method.

$_COOKIE: Contains an associative array of variables passed to the script via
 HTTP cookies.

$_SESSION: Stores and retrieves session-related data, allowing persistence 
of data across multiple requests.

$_FILES: Contains information about uploaded files via HTTP POST method.

$_REQUEST: Combines the values of $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE into a single array.

These superglobals are accessible from anywhere in the PHP script and can be used
to access user input, server information, and maintain state across multiple requests.
